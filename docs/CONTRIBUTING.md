## Try to Stick to

- **Boyscout Rule**: Leave the code better than you found it. Even small improvements help.
- **Run `scripts/test.sh` often**: Make sure your changes don't break existing functionality.
- **Pipeline must remain green**: All tests must pass before merging.
- **Functionality and security must not deteriorate**: Don't break things that work.

## Testing

Run the test suite frequently:

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```

This runs all tests, linting, and type checking. Keep it green.
